## Overview

Jean-Luc Picard gets up from his desk, pulls at his uniform to straighten it, and walks purposefully toward his replicator, 'tea...Earl Grey...hot' he says, frowning. Suddenly the ship begins to shake, alarms are going off. Picard slams his hand over his communicator, 'bridge...status report!', but there is no answer. He runs to the lift, heads to the bridge to find nobody there. 

Where in the hell is everyone? Picard sits himself down at the main scanner, in the place of Commander Worf who is amongst the missing crew members, he must scan the ship. 


## Scan the ship

It has been a while since Picard has had to operate the ship controls in this way. Usually, he just gives the orders! 'Curses' he shouts. 'This is fine' he sighs, and begins painfully looking through the computer. 

Can you help him find out how many places he will have to look? 

Make it so!
