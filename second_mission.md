## Overview

As Lieutenant Geordie Le Forge stands at the engineering room control panel, he calls to Data to pass him his tool box. Data doesn't answer, Geordie turns around and shouts 'woah, data...and...data?'. Data has multiplied. 

Before Geordie can ask any questions, or figure out what is happening both datas jump at each other and began fight. They roll through the opening door and into the hallway, and suddenly, disappear. 


## Find data, the right data

Geordie hits his communicator, 'Le Forge to bridge, we have a problem down here...', but the Lieutenant can't quite find the words to explain just what has gone wrong. 
'What is going on down there Lieutenant?' barks Captain Picard. 'Well sir, the thing is we have two datas, but right now, I can't find either of them?'.

Can you help?
But who is the real data. Can you find out? 

Make it so!
